\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In a text editor for writing \commonlisp{} source code, it is
desirable to have an accurate analysis of the buffer contents, so that
the role of the elements of the code can be indicated to the
programmer.  Furthermore, the buffer contents should preferably be
analyzed after each keystroke so that the programmer has up-to-date
information resulting from the analysis.

We describe an incremental parser that can be used as a key component
of such an analyzer.  The parser uses a special-purpose implementation
of the \commonlisp{} \texttt{read} function in combination of a
\emph{cache} that stores existing results of calling the reader.

Since the parser uses the standard \commonlisp{} reader, the resulting
analysis is very accurate.  Furthermore, the cache makes the parser
very fast in most common cases; re-parsing a buffer in which a single
character has been altered takes only a few milliseconds.
