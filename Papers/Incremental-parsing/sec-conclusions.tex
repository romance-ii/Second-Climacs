\section{Conclusions and future work}

Parsing \commonlisp{} source code is only the first step in the
analysis of its structure.  In order to determine the role of each
symbol and other information such as indentation, further analysis is
required.  Such analysis requires a \emph{code walker}, because the
role of a symbol may depend on the definitions of macros to which it
is an argument.
